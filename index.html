          Regular checkups are an important part of maintaining good health.
          They allow doctors to detect any health problems early, which makes
          treatment easier and more effective. These visits also give people the
          chance to ask questions and receive advice about their lifestyle. By
          going for checkups, we take small but powerful steps to protect our
          future and enjoy a longer, healthier life.

            <h3>Nutrition</h3>
            <p>
                 A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins fuels your body with essential vitamins and minerals. Staying hydrated and limiting processed foods can significantly boost energy, immunity, and overall wellness.

            <h3>Exercise</h3>
            <p>
               Engaging in at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily strengthens your heart, improves muscle tone, and enhances mental focus. Activities like walking, yoga, or strength training also help manage stress and maintain a healthy weight.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>Rest</h3>
            <p>
             Getting 7–9 hours of quality sleep each night allows your body to repair tissues, consolidate memories, and regulate mood. A consistent sleep schedule and a calming bedtime routine promote mental clarity and long-term health.

        <h2 >Role of Doctors in Society</h2>

        <p>
          Doctors play a vital role in society by guiding people toward better
          health. They treat patients, save lives, and offer comfort during
          difficult times. Their knowledge and care ensure that communities
          remain healthy and safe. Without doctors, society would struggle to
          fight diseases and improve the well-being of future generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Medical professionals work tirelessly to research new treatments,
          educate the public about health risks, and provide compassionate care
          to those in need. Their dedication often extends beyond regular
          working hours, demonstrating their commitment to serving humanity.
